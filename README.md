# LaWatchList
While LaWatchlist let user build their watchlist of movies, it helps them discover and search for new movies. 

#### Architecture
A ""Model View View-Model" architecture style was used in order to keep components and their responsablity cleaned and organized.

#### Libraries
I used :
- Retrofit in order to faciliate network calls, 
- Room coupled with LiveData for storange & persistence,
- Moshi for Json parsing,
- Glide to load images,
- Coroutine to make asynchronous tasks a breeze to work with.
